## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Webpack 5

### What I learned

This project was great practice as to dynamically updating page elements with JSON data as well as great practice in building and deploying a webpack application.

This was my first time importing assets into webpack and my first time importing JSON data rather than using fetch and async/await which was a great learning experience.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue using webpack to deploy projects to get more comfortable with it. Learning how to have a more uniform file structure will only benefit me. I'm also going to continue practicing building front end apps and using JSON data to dynamically update page content.
